## üìã Overview

This interactive dashboard provides clinicians and researchers with validated predictive models for CAR-T therapy outcomes in 2L DLBCL based on pre-treatment patient characteristics. The tool synthesizes evidence from landmark clinical trials (ZUMA-1, JULIET, TRANSCEND) and implements published scoring systems to support clinical decision-making.

### Key Features

- **Multi-layered Risk Assessment**: Integrates clinical, laboratory, imaging, and genomic parameters
- **Validated Scoring Systems**: CAR-HEMATOTOX and IPET score calculators
- **Product-Specific Analysis**: Comprehensive toxicity profiles for all three approved products
- **Evidence-Based Predictions**: Outcome probabilities based on published clinical data
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Risk charts and comparative analysis tools

## üî¨ Clinical Foundation

The dashboard is built on the **multi-layered predictive framework** described in current literature:

### Layer 1: Pre-treatment Factors
- Patient demographics (age, ECOG performance status)
- Disease burden (LDH, tumor volume, stage)
- Laboratory markers (inflammatory signature, cytopenias)
- Genomic features (TP53, MYC status, cell of origin)

### Layer 2: CAR-T Product Characteristics
- Axicabtagene ciloleucel (CD28 costimulation)
- Tisagenlecleucel (4-1BB costimulation)  
- Lisocabtagene maraleucel (4-1BB costimulation)

### Layer 3: On-treatment Dynamics
- CAR-T expansion kinetics
- Toxicity development (CRS, ICANS)
- Treatment response patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Charts**: Chart.js for data visualization
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages compatible

## üìä Implemented Models

### 1. Comprehensive Risk Assessment
- Weighted scoring system based on clinical evidence
- Risk stratification: Low (0-3), Intermediate (4-7), High (8+)
- Outcome predictions: CR rate, PFS, OS, toxicity risks

### 2. CAR-HEMATOTOX Score
- Predicts severe cytopenias post-CAR-T infusion
- Components: Hemoglobin, platelets, CRP, ferritin
- Validated risk thresholds with clinical implications

### 3. IPET Score
- International Prognostic Index adaptation for CAR-T
- Risk factors: Stage, LDH, absolute neutrophil count
- Prognostic stratification with expected outcomes

### 4. Toxicity Analysis
- Product-specific CRS and ICANS profiles
- ASTCT consensus grading criteria
- Management guidelines by severity grade

## üè• Clinical Applications

- **Patient Selection**: Identify optimal CAR-T candidates
- **Risk Stratification**: Predict likelihood of response and toxicity
- **Treatment Planning**: Inform monitoring and management strategies
- **Education**: Teaching tool for CAR-T therapy principles
- **Research**: Hypothesis generation and study design support

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cart-outcome-predictor.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser

3. No additional setup required - runs entirely in the browser

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Risk Assessment Workflow
1. **Input Patient Data**: Enter clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters
2. **Calculate Risk Score**: Click "Calculate Risk Assessment" to generate predictions
3. **Review Results**: Analyze risk category, outcome probabilities, and contributing factors
4. **Use Specialized Scores**: Apply CAR-HEMATOTOX and IPET models for specific assessments

### Interpreting Results
- **Low Risk (0-3 points)**: 75% CR rate, favorable outcomes expected
- **Intermediate Risk (4-7 points)**: 60% CR rate, moderate toxicity risk
- **High Risk (8+ points)**: 40% CR rate, intensive monitoring required

## üî¨ Evidence Base

### Pivotal Clinical Trials
- **ZUMA-1**: Axicabtagene ciloleucel registration study
- **JULIET**: Tisagenlecleucel long-term follow-up
- **TRANSCEND**: Lisocabtagene maraleucel pivotal trial
- **TRANSFORM**: Second-line randomized study

### Validation Studies
- InflaMix inflammatory biomarker model
- CAR-HEMATOTOX cytopenia prediction
- EASIX/m-EASIX toxicity scores
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinical Disclaimers

- **Educational Purpose**: This tool is for research and educational use only
- **Not for Clinical Decisions**: Clinical management should always involve qualified healthcare providers
- **Individual Variation**: Patient outcomes may vary significantly from model predictions
- **Continuous Updates**: Clinical evidence evolves rapidly; refer to current literature
